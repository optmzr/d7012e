% 	3. A string of special characters, e.g. @=.
%

% 	Because most implementations of Prolog implements reasoning over
% 	integers.
%
% 3. What does "symbolic" programming mean?

% 	to treat itself as data, and manipulate it.
%
% 4. With what characters can the name of a variable start?
%	Upper case letter and _.
%
% 5. What is, if anything, the difference between an atom and a functor?
